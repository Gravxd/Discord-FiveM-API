# Discord-FiveM-API

**[SUPPORTS V11 + V12]** - Discord-js

My previous status bots utilised the `gamedig` api which has since been causing issues for both myself and other people that i know use my code.

I decided to find a new api and then make a new bot.

Once you install this code, go to your terminal and use `npm install`.

This will install all neccessary packages required for the bot.

Go to the index.js where it says `const serverID = '';`



Update the serverID to the id of your discord server.
Update che channelID to the id of the channel you want the status in.
Update the messageID to the id of the message you want to use for the status.

Use grav!setup to get all of the id's.

Any issues, join the [support server!](https://discord.gg/ZYHxxba)
